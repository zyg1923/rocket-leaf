/**
 * Shell for the right-hand detail pane: width, edge, background, entrance and
 * exit animation, and the accessible name.
 *
 * Deliberately only the shell — the three panels hold genuinely different
 * content and forcing a shared body would be a false abstraction. What they
 * should not differ on is the frame, and they did: 360, 420 and 460px, with
 * the topic panel switching width between its loading and loaded states.
 *
 * The width is capped against the viewport as well, so a narrow window no
 * longer leaves the list squeezed against the panel.
