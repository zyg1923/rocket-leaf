# Rocket Leaf Architecture

## Process model

```text
React UI (system WebView)
        │ Wails bindings — direct, in-process calls
internal/bridge      ── the only layer allowed to reshape data for the UI
        │
internal/service     ── domain logic
        │
RocketMQ Admin API / local encrypted settings
```

The application is a single process. The UI runs in the platform WebView
(WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux) and reaches Go
through generated bindings, so there is no local HTTP server, no auth token and
no child process to supervise.

## The bridge layer

`internal/bridge` exposes one Wails service per domain. Its methods delegate
straight to `internal/service`, and it is the only place that reshapes data on
the way out:

- Stored AccessKey / SecretKey values never leave the Go process. The bridge
  replaces them with `accessKeyConfigured` / `secretKeyConfigured` flags.
- Connection and settings updates carry an explicit credential mode:
  `preserve`, `replace` or `clear`.
- Config file paths and plaintext exports stay in Go: `SystemService` owns the
  file dialogs, reads and writes the file, and returns only the chosen path.
- External links are checked against a host allowlist before being handed to
  the OS browser.

`wails3 generate bindings` writes the TypeScript for these services into
`frontend/bindings/`, typed directly from the Go structs. `npm run check` fails
if the committed bindings drift from the Go source.

## Frontend seams

The UI never calls a binding directly. Two modules sit in between:

- `frontend/src/api/*.ts` wraps each bound service and is the only place that
  knows the binding shapes.
- `frontend/src/api/models.ts` re-exports the generated domain types under the
  vocabulary the pages use, including friendlier names for the generated enums.

Window chrome (minimise, maximise, close, drag regions) is driven by the Wails
window runtime from the frontend; only the native background colour, which has
to stay in step with the light/dark theme, goes through a Go service.

## macOS title bar

The renderer paints the title bar itself, so the native traffic lights have to
line up with it. Wails exposes no equivalent of Electron's
`trafficLightPosition`, so `internal/macwindow` moves the standard window
buttons through a small Objective-C shim. AppKit rebuilds the themed frame on
resize and when leaving fullscreen, which resets the buttons, so the shim keeps
a positioner attached to the window and re-applies the offset on those
notifications. It leaves the buttons alone while the window is fullscreen,
where AppKit owns them.

The geometry lives in two places that must agree: `titleBarHeight` and
`trafficLightLeft` in `main.go`, and the `.rl-title-bar` rule in
`frontend/src/styles/app.css`.

## Build

`Taskfile.yml` drives everything through the `wails3` CLI: `wails3 task dev` for
hot reload, `wails3 task build` for a binary, `wails3 task package` for a
distributable. The app version lives in `package.json` and is injected into the
binary with `-ldflags "-X main.version=..."`.

Bumping it means editing `package.json`, both lockfiles, `frontend/package.json`
and `info.version` in `build/config.yml`, then running
`wails3 task common:update:build-assets` to regenerate the committed platform
manifests. Those manifests are what the packaged artifacts declare to the OS, so
`npm run check:version` verifies them too and names any that are stale.

The app id stays `com.rocketleaf.app` and the user data directory stays
`rocket-leaf`, so local data from earlier versions remains compatible.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same gate on pushes and pull requests.
`release.yml` packages a tag. Its runner matrix follows what each platform needs
to compile: macOS builds both slices from one SDK and joins them with `lipo`,
Windows cross-compiles both architectures from one runner because it does not
need cgo, and Linux does, so each architecture gets a runner of its own.
