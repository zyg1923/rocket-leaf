// Package bridge exposes the business services to the frontend as Wails services.
//
// Every exported method on a bridge service becomes a callable binding in the
// renderer. The bridge is the only place allowed to reshape business data for
// the UI: it redacts secrets that must never leave the Go process and resolves
// the credential modes the settings and connection forms rely on.
